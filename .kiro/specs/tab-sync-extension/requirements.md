# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Chromium browser extension that enables users to synchronize their browser tabs across multiple devices using Google or GitHub authentication. The extension provides manual, user-controlled synchronization with conflict resolution capabilities and a dedicated settings interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with my Google or GitHub account, so that I can securely sync my tabs across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension for the first time THEN the system SHALL present authentication options for Google and GitHub
2. WHEN the user selects an authentication provider THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth flow for the selected provider
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store authentication tokens securely
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
5. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display the user's profile information in the extension

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually trigger tab synchronization, so that I have control over when my tabs are synced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uses the keyboard shortcut THEN the system SHALL trigger the sync process
2. WHEN the user clicks the sync button in the extension popup THEN the system SHALL initiate synchronization
3. WHEN sync is triggered THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before proceeding
4. IF the user cancels the sync confirmation THEN the system SHALL abort the sync process
5. WHEN sync proceeds THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators during the operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage extension settings, so that I can configure sync behavior and view sync status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension settings page THEN the system SHALL display current sync status
2. WHEN viewing settings THEN the system SHALL show the last sync timestamp and device information
3. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL allow users to configure keyboard shortcuts
4. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to sign out and clear local data
5. WHEN viewing sync history THEN the system SHALL display a list of recent sync operations with timestamps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to merge tab changes from multiple devices, so that I don't lose tabs when syncing between devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tabs exist on both local and remote devices THEN the system SHALL detect conflicts
2. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL present a merge interface to the user
3. WHEN merging THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which tabs to keep from each device
4. WHEN merge is completed THEN the system SHALL apply changes to both local tabs and remote storage
5. IF no conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL automatically merge tabs without user intervention

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tab data to be stored securely in the cloud, so that my browsing information is protected and accessible across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tab data is synced THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information before storage
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use the authenticated user's cloud storage (Google Drive or GitHub)
3. WHEN retrieving data THEN the system SHALL decrypt and validate data integrity
4. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prevent sync
5. WHEN user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all local cached data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure keyboard shortcuts for sync operations, so that I can quickly access sync functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL register default keyboard shortcuts
2. WHEN user accesses shortcut settings THEN the system SHALL display current key bindings
3. WHEN user modifies shortcuts THEN the system SHALL validate for conflicts with browser shortcuts
4. IF shortcut conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN shortcuts are saved THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new key bindings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed sync status and history, so that I can understand what was synced and when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL log the operation with timestamp and device info
2. WHEN viewing sync status THEN the system SHALL show number of tabs synced and any errors
3. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and suggested actions
4. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL show sync operations from all connected devices
5. WHEN tabs are merged THEN the system SHALL log which tabs were added, removed, or modified
